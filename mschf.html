               <section class="mschf"><p>MSCHF is a newer sneaker brand that has taken the internet by storm with different clothes, designs and other extremely weird looking sneakers. MSCHF has made sneakers such as the MSCHF big red boots, not to brag but I actually own a pair and they are crazy looking, they also make gobstompers which are shoes that are one color and as they deteriorate they turn into a different color scheme with time. I personally love them and would love to get some more but they are a little bit overpriced for my liking.</p></section>
