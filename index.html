               <section class="bigbox"><p>Sneakers are very cool to me, they can be heavy, they can be light, they can be thick or thin or short and small but there are many different unique designs in sneakers that really stand out to me. Some examples are Yeezy's, Jordans, Balenciaga's and many other brands. I also love the colord and some of the celebrities who created these masterpieces. I've been researching many different sneakers and my top favourites are Jordans, Yeezy's, Lamelo's and MSCHF.<br><br>

I love sneakers, I have been collecting for a year or two and have many shoes, I started with a pair of Jordan 13's which I loved and I still have. Ever since I've been collecting new shoes such as Yeezy 350's which I have 2 pairs of, many more jordans, air forces, also Yeezy foam runnes, basketball shoes and one pair of MSCHF big red boots aka my prized possesion. I really love my shoes and hope to collect much more in the future.</p></section>
